+Ecco la versione in inglese, semplice, naturale e tutta filata:
+
+Create a mini app called “Base Mini App Factory Guide”. The app should serve as a simple, beginner-friendly guide that helps users understand how to create their first mini app with the Base Mini App Factory. When the user opens the app, show a short introduction explaining what the Mini App Factory is: a tool that lets anyone build a mini app in minutes by describing it in natural language.
+
+The app should guide the user step by step. First, explain how to describe their app idea clearly. Then explain how to submit the description, how the generation process works, and what happens when the app is ready to be deployed. Each step should be explained in short, direct sentences, as if it were a tutorial for absolute beginners.
+
+Include a section that explains the key concepts: what no-code creation means, how the automatic generation system works, what “deploying on Base” means, and how users can update or improve their app after it has been created.
+
+Add a FAQ page with short answers to common questions such as: “How long does it take?”, “Can I edit my app?”, “What happens during deployment?”, and “Do I need technical experience?”. Keep the tone clear, friendly, and supportive.
+
+The interface should be simple and easy to navigate, with a small menu linking to “Introduction”, “How to Create a Mini App”, “Key Concepts”, and “FAQ”. Use a clean layout and readable colors. The goal is to make the user feel confident, supported, and ready to build their first mini app independently.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
